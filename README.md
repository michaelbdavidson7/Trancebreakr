# Trancebreakr

Ever lose track of time and stay up too late, ruining your next day? 

Does this happen to your kid?

Trancebreakr is a program to create Windows Scheduled Tasks that 
1) shuts down the computer at a designated time
2) gives a warning x minutes before shutting down. 

Add or delete the tasks from the program. 


# Troubleshooting

If you uninstalled this app and don't know where to look to remove the shutdown tasks, go to Task Scheduler on your computer and they will be there.
