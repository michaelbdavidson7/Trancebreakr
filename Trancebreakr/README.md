# How to deploy

- Run build in Release mode
- Publish to a spot on your local pc
- Go to that folder where you put the files, look in Application Files and delete all previous versions
- Run Inno Script to the exact version of the folder that had local pc, which shoots out an exe file - eg version 1.1 would be the trancebreakr_1_1 folder or whatever, but scope it just to that.
- Create a new release in Github and drop it there
